Pre-launch refactoring and documentation consolidation

OVERVIEW
========
Comprehensive pre-launch code quality improvements, documentation 
consolidation, and project cleanup in preparation for production 
deployment (Target: Week of Jan 6-12, 2026).

Project Status: 85% Complete - Beta Ready

CODE QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS
==========================
- Fix deprecated Tailwind CSS v4 classes (bg-gradient-to-br → bg-linear-to-br, flex-shrink-0 → shrink-0)
- Remove all debug console.log() statements from production code
- Improve error handling in API routes and components
- Add .eslintignore for archived files
- Update .gitignore to properly exclude database files

DOCUMENTATION CONSOLIDATION
============================
Created comprehensive documentation:
- COMPREHENSIVE_DOCUMENTATION.md - Single source of truth (5000+ lines)
- LAUNCH_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md - Complete pre-launch roadmap
- REFACTORING_SUMMARY.md - Summary of refactoring work
- KNOWN_ISSUES.md - Current issues and limitations tracking

Archived legacy documentation (moved to _archived/):
- DEVELOPER_LOG.md
- EXECUTION_ROADMAP.md  
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md
- STREAMLINING_ANALYSIS.md
- CALENDAR_IMPROVEMENTS.md
- RESERVATION_SYSTEM_ENHANCEMENT.md

PROJECT CLEANUP
===============
Moved deprecated files to _archived/:

- Fee management

✅ Quality Assurance:
- All tests passing (15 passed, 7 skipped)

- ESLint clean (archived files ignored)

REMAINING WORK FOR PRODUCTION
==============================
Critical path items (3-5 days):
1. Azure AD integration (code ready, needs credentials)
2. Production server deployment setup
3. PostgreSQL migration (optional for initial launch)
4. User acceptance testing
5. Load testing

See LAUNCH_READINESS_CHECKLIST.md for complete details.
